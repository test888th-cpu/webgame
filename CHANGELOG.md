# Changelog

Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow SemVer.

## [Unreleased]

### Added — Character art pipeline and first art pack
- `tools/assets/`: LPC character builder (pinned generator commit, licence policy,
  recolouring, credits), UnitForge "Godot 4" export importer, SpriteFrames
  generator, asset validator and 14 pipeline unit tests; `Assets` workflow to
  build/import in the cloud; CI job validating every asset. See `docs/ASSETS.md`.
- Nine LPC-built characters (CC0/OGA-BY/CC-BY only): hero Mika and an armoured
  variant (shown when the Work Jacket is equipped), NPCs Ama and Chief Odo, and all
  five enemy types including the elite and the boss. `FighterView` plays them with
  `AnimatedSprite2D`, attack frames stepped by simulation ticks.
- Title screen: Characters (gallery) and Credits.
- Tar Hound renamed "Tar Rat" to match its art.
- Generated scenery for every area (`tools/assets/gen_environment.py`, original
  MIT art): sky and parallax skyline, themed facades (depot warehouses and
  containers, market shophouses and stalls, canal factories and water), detailed
  street, props and lamp glow. Validated for freshness in CI.

### Added — Milestone 2, part 2: playable single-player loop
- Title screen (New game / Continue), pause menu, inventory and equipment, shop,
  quest dialog and log, game over with a coin penalty, notifications, boss HP bar.
- Three areas from `data/areas.json`: Depot Yard (home: vendor, quest giver, training
  dummy, heals on entry), Saltmarket Street and Canal Works, joined by exits.
- Enemies from `data/enemies.json`: Smogling, Tar Hound, Pipe Brute, elite Smog Warden
  and a two-phase boss, the Sludge Foreman. `EnemyBrain` AI keeps spacing, lines up,
  reacts and swings; at most two attack at once (attack tokens); telegraphed heavies
  show a warning. Enemies push apart instead of stacking.
- Encounters with waves lock the arena until cleared and reset on re-entry (farming).
- Rewards decided by the zone simulation from a seeded generator: XP and levels,
  money and item drops from loot tables, quest progress. Items, shops, quests and
  progression are data (`items.json`, `shops.json`, `quests.json`, `progression.json`),
  validated together with cross-references by `ContentDB`.
- `PlayerProfile` with versioned, sanitising (de)serialisation; local save via
  `SaveStore` (atomic write; IndexedDB in browsers), autosave on area change, defeat,
  purchase and quest hand-in.
- 30 new tests (69 total); the test runner now ignores warnings but still fails on
  errors. The browser smoke test plays title -> new game -> dummy combo -> pause ->
  next area -> a real street fight.

### Added — Milestone 2, part 1: combat core
- Deterministic 60 Hz combat simulation in `client/sim/` (`CombatRules`, `Fighter`,
  `FighterInput`, `CombatEvent`): light combo jab → cross → body hook (chains only
  after a connected hit), guard-breaking haymaker, dodge with invulnerability frames,
  guard (front only, chip damage, energy drain, guard break), hit stun, knockback,
  knockdown, KO, simultaneous-hit trades.
- Attacks are data: `client/data/moves.json`, loaded and validated by `MoveLibrary`.
- Test zone: training dummy with HP bar and respawn, HUD HP/energy bars, floating
  damage numbers, keyboard/gamepad/touch bindings for light, heavy, dodge, guard.
- 23 new tests (39 total). Browser smoke test now lands a combo on the dummy.
- `pages.yml` plays the live HTTPS site after each deploy.

### Security
- Asset tools pin Pillow 13.0.0: dependency review flagged 20+ HIGH advisories in
  12.3.0 (PDF, TIFF, JPEG, GIF decoders). Rebuilt assets are byte-identical.

### Changed
- CI jobs have time limits. The smoke test installs only Chromium's headless shell
  (cached) instead of `--with-deps`, which spent 10+ minutes on a slow apt mirror.
- Light hits push less (jab 4 px, cross 6 px) so the combo stays in reach.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-10-23 (Milestone 1 / Task 001)

### Added — Milestone 1 / Task 001: cloud build pipeline
- Godot 4.7.2 client project (`client/`): test street, placeholder hero with lane movement
  (keyboard, gamepad, touch), bounded camera, HUD.
- Shared rules module `client/sim/LaneMovement.gd` with unit tests.
- Headless Godot test runner that fails tests on any engine or script error.
- Release web export preset (single-threaded, Compatibility renderer).
- Browser smoke test (Playwright + Chromium) that verifies boot and keyboard movement.
- API service skeleton (Node 24.22.1, Fastify): `/healthz`, `/readyz`, checksummed
  forward-only migration runner, migration `0001_accounts`.
- CI: repository policy, gdlint/gdformat, Godot tests, web export + smoke test + artifact
  with SHA-256 manifest, backend tests on PostgreSQL 16, image build + Trivy + SBOM.
  Security: gitleaks, npm audit, dependency review. Gated GitHub Pages deployment of the
  CI artifact.
- Documentation set and repository audit.

### Security
- Runtime image drops npm, npx and corepack (multi-stage build). Their bundled
  `brace-expansion` 5.0.9 and `undici` 6.28.0 had HIGH CVEs (CVE-2026-102276,
  CVE-2026-102278, CVE-2026-19534) reported by Trivy; the API never runs them.
